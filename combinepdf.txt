Multiple gene cascades required for ovarian cycle

Timeline of follicular development

Depletion of oocytes over reproductive span

Follicular “wave”
• Three events in a follicular wave
– Recruitment – a group of small antral follicles
grow and start producing E2
– Selection – from the recruited group of follicles
that have not undergone atresia, medium-sized
follicles develop and continue producing E2
– Dominance – from the selected group of follicles
that have not undergone atresia, large potentially
preovulatory follicles develop and continue
producing E2

Pleotropic effects of FSH on the granulosa cell

• Cell division and
growth
• Increases in
aromatase
• Increases in LH

• Estradiol increases
FSH receptors and
augments FSH effects,
e.g., mitosis in granulosa
cells and E2 production!!
• Androgen supply for E2
synthesis is not limiting!!
From Senger

Follicular selection
• Selection of ovarian follicles for ovulation
– Mare (1-2) and ruminants (2-3) have waves of follicular
growth that occur during the estrous cycle
– If the first 1 or 2 waves occur during the luteal phase and
under CL/progesterone domination these waves do not
generate a follicle that ovulates; exception, 5% of mares
ovulate during the luteal phase - anomaly
– The wave that develops when the CL is regressing and
progesterone  generates a follicle that ovulates
– Therefore, the factor that determines the number of
waves in an ovarian cycle is when the CL regresses relative
to the current follicular wave

Follicular selection
• Many will be recruited
to grow; only one will be
selected
• “threshold” theory of
selection
– Dominant follicle
secretes E2 to inhibit
growth of other follicles

Life cycle of dominant follicle

Follicular competition
• How does the dominant follicle maintain its status as
“dominant” or destined to ovulate (maybe ovulate,
depending on when the wave occurs)?
– Inhibin – Granulosa cells produce inhibin which suppresses
FSH
• [Inhibin] is greater at this point than earlier
• The  FSH robs the smaller follicles of FSH support, but the
dominant follicle is more tolerant of the reduced [FSH] because it’s
larger with more FSHR!!

– The greater E2 production by the dominant follicle is also
believed to increase blood flow in its direction

Growth vs. recruitment
• Follicular
growth from
primordial to
2ary follicle is
gonadotropinindependent
• Recruitment
and selection
of dominant
follicle requires

Ovarian Follicle Development

From Senger

Ovarian Cycles
• Definition – the interval between successive
ovulations in the nonpregnant female
• Two phases in an ovarian cycle:
follicular (follicle, E2) & luteal (CL, P4)
• Spontaneous ovulators - E2 production by the
Graafian follicle stimulates PO surge of GnRH
and FSH and LH* for ovulation
Primates, domestic species, rodents

Ovarian Cycles
• Species differences with respect to separation of
follicular and luteal phases
– Primate-no significant follicular growth in luteal phase (See
FSH and suppression by progesterone)
– Large domestic species-waves of follicular growth occur
during the luteal phase
– Dog – follicular waves during luteal phase?

• Longer interval between CL regression and ovulation
in primates
• Ovarian cycles are longer in primates
– 28 days vs 17-22 days in large domestic species

Endometrial/cervical/vaginal cycles
• Hormonal cycles
impact all female
reproductive
tissues
• Endometrial cycle
marked by phases:
– Proliferative
– Secretory
– menstrual

Ovarian Cycles
• Induced or reflex ovulators
– Require copulation for ovulation
• Species include rabbits, cats, camelids, mink, ferrets, bears,
skunks, raccoons, voles, shrews

– Hypothalamus is insensitive to positive feedback effect of
E2 from the mature follicles
– Waves of follicular growth occur but no ovulation unless
copulation
– Many species have alternating periods of sexual receptivity
(an actual estrus or heat), e.g., mink, ferret, cat, some
camelids
– Others are somewhat continually receptive, e.g., rabbits
and llamas

Ovarian Cycles
• Follicular activity in induced ovulators
– Why is [progesterone] low in the queen?
– Predict the E2 profile in the llama

Ovarian Cycles
• Neuroendocrine reflex arc for ovulation induction in
the reflex ovulator

From Senger

Ovarian Cycles
• What happens after ovulation is induced in
the reflex ovulator?

Queen

Ovarian Cycles
• Modification of the luteal phase by copulation –
Most rodents (rats, mice and hamsters)
• Rats, mice and hamsters have a 4-5 day ovarian cycle
(estrous cycle)
• SPONTANEOUS OVULATORS
• SHORT period of corpus luteum development (1-2
days) with little progesterone produced
• Copulation induces the neuroendocrine reflex arc for
PRL release and luteal maintenance occurs for 10-12
days

Cervical/vaginal stimulation

Ovarian Cycles
• Pseudopregnancy in the reflex ovulator is not equivalent to
pseudopregnancy in the dog although they may be
physiologically similar
• The dog is a spontaneous ovulator
• The pseudopregnancy term in dogs is somewhat of a common
term used to identify diestrus, a specific phase of the estrous
cycle
• Diestrus in the dog is neither induced by mating nor
dependent on copulation for extension of luteal lifespan
• In fact, the dog is one of the rare species where luteal lifespan
in the nonpregnant female is usually longer than in the
pregnant female

Ovulation
• In the spontaneous ovulator, the dominant follicle,
thru E2 production, brings about it’s own ovulation
by inducing the PO surge of gonadotropins,
especially LH
• Regardless of spontaneous/induced species, the PO
LH surge is significant; as much as a 10-fold increase
from tonic [LH]
• Depending on sp., the oocyte is liberated from the
Graafian follicle between 12 (lab species) to 36
(swine) hr from the LH peak

Ovulation
• Role of the LH surge in ovulation
– Remember---the granulosa cells have recently
acquired LH R
– Decreases production of oocyte meiosis inhibiting
factor by the granulosa cells
• Meiotically-arrested dictyate oocyte in prophase of
meiosis I resumes meiosis and develops until
metaphase of meiosis II where it again arrests as a
secondary oocyte
– Most sp, ovulated oocyte is a secondary oocyte in Metaphase
II……….plus a polar body
– Dog – ovulated oocyte is a primary oocyte in Metaphase
I……….no polar body yet

Ovulation

• Role of the LH surge in ovulation
– Decreases production of a luteinizing inhibiting
factor by the granulosa/thecal cells
• Factor involved in preventing premature luteinization of
the follicle cells
– Belongs to the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family of
growth factors

• Granulosa cells transform/luteinize into granulosa
lutein cells and convert from estrogen to progesterone
production
• Theca interna cells transform/luteinize into theca lutein
cells and convert from androgen to progesterone
production

Ovulation

• Role of the LH surge in ovulation
– Induction of a proteolytic cascade at the
follicular apex to cause rupture of the
follicle wall and liberation of the oocyte

LH causes ovulation via increased activity of
prostaglandins

LH is pleotropic at point of ovulation

Ovulation

From Ohnishi et al., 2005

Ovulation

Ovulation

Corpus Luteum
• Post-ovulation
– Corpus hemorrhagicum – clot-like semisolid
structure; lasts approx 2-3 days; some
progesterone production
• Dogs and primates – progesterone production starts
before ovulation, during the preovulatory LH surge

– Corpus luteum develops

Corpus Luteum
• Composed of two cell types
– Granulosa lutein cells
• “Large” cells
• Contribute to CL mass thru hypertrophy
• Contain oxytocin and relaxin
• High progesterone producers

– Theca lutein cells
• “Small” cells
• Contribute to CL mass thru hyperplasia
• Low progesterone producers

Corpus Luteum

From Senger

(StAR)

Corpus Luteum
• Maintenance of the corpus luteum
– Principal luteotropin is LH
– Tonic [LH] is sufficient to maintain CL integrity and
progesterone synthesis
– Mechanism of action thru PKA
– PRL is luteotropic in rodents and partly involved as
a luteotropin in sheep and dogs (maybe cats)

Corpus Luteum
• In the nonpregnant female, the absence of the embryo
permits regression of the corpus luteum (luteolysis)
– Dependent on a factor produced by the uterus
– Loeb (1923) – found that hysterectomy extended the luteal
phase in guinea pigs
– PGF2a is the luteolysin produced by the uterus that causes
regression of the CL in most species
– Uterine PGF2a does not appear to be the natural luteolysin in
non-pregnant dogs, cats & primates*
• *Some evidence in primates that the luteolytic factor is of ovarian
origin and either PGF2a or another PG
• Luteolytic at parturition in dogs & cats
• PGF2a is used as an abortant in dogs and cats

Corpus Luteum
• Luteolysis
– Luteolysis is initiated 12-16 days post ovulation
(exact timing dependent on length of sp estrous
cycle)
– Modes of transfer from the uterus to the ovary
• Local countercurrent transfer
– Movement of PGF2a from higher concentrations in the uteroovarian vein to lower concentrations in the ovarian artery

• General systemic transfer
– Passage of PGF2a into the systemic circulation

Corpus Luteum
• Local countercurrent transfer

From Cunningham and
Klein

Corpus Luteum
• Luteolysis
– Local countercurrent transfer
• Cow and ewe – important because 90% of uterine PGF2a is
metabolized in the lungs
• Sow – possesses countercurrent transfer but only 40%
metabolized in the lungs
• Effect is “local”
– Unilateral hysterectomy contralateral (uterine horn opposite to
the side with the CL) to the CL results in no change in luteal life
span – CL regresses as expected
– Unilateral hysterectomy ipsilateral (uterine horn on the same
side as CL) to the CL results in extended luteal life span

Corpus Luteum

From Senger

Corpus Luteum
–General systemic transfer
• Sow – possesses countercurrent transfer but
only 40% metabolized in the lungs
• Mare – does not possess countercurrent
transfer but metabolizes PGF2a more slowly and
the CL is more sensitive to PGF2a

Corpus Luteum
• Luteolytic Mechanism
– Luteolysis requires
pulses of PGF2a

– Minimum of 4-5
pulses within 24 hr for
complete CL regression
From Cunningham and Klein

Corpus Luteum
• Induction of PGF2a synthesis
• The “key”?
– Prolonged exposure to progesterone causes the
endometrial cell to down-regulate progesterone receptors
(ovulation “sets the clock”)
– Endometrial E2 receptors have been suppressed by
progesterone mechanism of action
– When progesterone effect diminishes, E2 receptors increase
– Follicular E2 binds the endometrial E2 receptor and induces
synthesis of oxytocin receptor mRNA which is translated
into protein
– Oxytocin binds and induces PGF2a synthesis

Corpus Luteum
• The model
for induction
of PGF2a
synthesis

How does PGF2a induce luteolysis?
• Four mechanisms
– Vasoconstriction
– Block luteotrophic
effects of LH by  cAMP
– Apoptosis
(programmed cell
death) induced by
 Ca+2 in the cell
– Apoptosis is induced
by tumor necrosis factor
produced by cells of the
immune system

• Development of a
positive feedback loop
between oxytocin and
PGF2a synthesis

Corpus Luteum
• Non-pregnant dogs and cats do not rely on
PGF2a for luteolysis
– Luteal phases

• Dog, 70 days
• Cat following an induced ovulation, 30-50 days

– Mechanism of luteal regression?
• Absence of relaxin for Prl stimulation?
• Luteal cell aging?
• Some relevance to other sp when considering the
effects of bilateral uterectomy

Changes in luteal lifespan
• Presence of an embryo extends luteal lifespan
– Blocks luteolytic action of PGF2a or
– Provides a luteotropin

• Mare
– Prolonged luteal phase (prolonged diestrus)
– Maybe 1-2 months in duration
– Inadequate synthesis and release of PGF2a

• Uterine infection

– Generally, shortens luteal phase due to premature release
of PGF2a
– Mare
• Chronic endometritis = prolonged luteal phase
• Acute endometritis = shortened luteal phase

• Absence of an uterine horn

Reproductive Cycles
• Types:
– Estrous and Menstrual Cycles
– Physiologically similar
– Onset of the cycle differs
• Estrous cycle - Onset or Day O of the cycle starts with
estrus which behaviorally is designated as sexual
receptivity to the male (heat); possible exception is
the dog
• Menstrual cycle - Onset or Day 0 of the cycle starts
with menstruation (menses; vaginal discharge of
blood-tinged fluids and tissues)

Estrous Cycle
• Estrus derived from oistros; Greek for
“frenzy”
• Four phases
– Estrus
– Metestrus
– Diestrus
– Proestrus

• Some sp modifications depending on
physiology of the female

Estrous Cycle

From Senger

Estrous Cycle
• Estrus
– First phase of the cycle
– Phase associated with sexual receptivity to the
male
– Ovulation occurs here for most sp except cow
and goat
– Reflex ovulators can have an estrus
– Endocrine profile
• High/declining E2
• FSH/LH surge
• Low Progesterone (P4)

Estrous Cycle
• Metestrus
– Post-ovulatory phase for most species except
cow and goat
• Cow ovulates mid-metestrus
• Goat (doe) ovulates early metestrus

– Corpus hemorrhagicum transition to CL
– P4 secretion begins

Estrous Cycle
• Diestrus
– Phase of the functional CL
– High [P4]
– Near end of diestrus, PGF2a spiking

• Proestrus
– Phase of the regressing CL and declining [P4]
– Growth and maturation of preovulatory
follicles
– Increasing E2 secretion

Estrous Cycle
• Proestrus and estrus = follicular phase
– Dominated by maturing follicle and E2 as
major ovarian steroid
– Occupies about 25% of estrous cycle duration

• Metestrus and diestrus = luteal phase
– Dominated by corpus luteum and P4 as major
ovarian steroid
– Occupies about 75% of estrous cycle duration

Estrous Cycle
• Behavioral description
– Because only estrus has a defined behavior
associated with it, a female can be referred to
as in estrus or nonestrus
– Estrus
• Females exhibit lordosis behavior (“mating
posture”), arching of the back and a rigid stance,
as well as receptivity to the male

– Nonestrus
• Includes metestrus, diestrus and proestrus

Estrous Cycle

P

PGF2a

Estrous Cycle
• Anestrus = lack of ovarian activity
• Polyestrus = continuous estrous cycles unless
physiology changes to cause anestrus
• Seasonality = photoperiod induced changes in onset
of estrous cycles
– Seasonal = species possess a “breeding season” and a
“nonbreeding” or anestrous season linked to
photoperiod, e.g., mare, queen, ewe, goat (doe)
– Nonseasonal = species have estrous cycles throughout
the year and cycles are unaffected by photoperiod, e.g.,
cow, sow

• Monoestrus = Strict definition is “one estrous cycle
per year” but more realistic description is an
anestrus separating each estrous cycle, e.g., dog

Estrous Cycle
• Mare

From McDonald

Mean duration=22 d

Estrous Cycle
• Mare – several unique features
– Most species ovulate relative to estrus onset,
however the mare ovulates relative to the end
of estrus (24-48 h before the end)
– Estrus can be “split” - days of non-receptivity
between days of receptivity
– LH surge is of prolonged duration, 10 d; most
sp, 12-24 h
• Peak LH is actually after ovulation

– FSH – two waves dominate the cycle
• The luteal wave may explain the 5% incidence of
luteal phase ovulation

Estrous Cycle
• Mare

Estrous Cycle
• Dog

Variable duration;
not really a season

Mean duration= 7-8 months
From McDonald

Mean duration = 75 d

Estrous Cycle
• Dog – several unique features
– Monoestrus
• Little influence of photoperiod in the domestic dog
• Major criterion – anestrus is actually part of the
estrous cycle; each estrous cycle is separated by an
anestrus or phase of ovarian inactivity
– Anestrus can range from 15-265 d (mean=125 d); if anestrus
is short, up to 3 cycles/yr; if long, only 1 cycle/yr

– Proestrus bleeding – onset of vaginal bloody
discharge signals onset of proestrus

Estrous Cycle
• Dog
– Onset of estrus coincides with LH surge ( );
ovulation occurs 3-5 d after surge; Note P4 ( )
– Ovulates Metaphase I oocytes
– Diestrus > duration of pregnancy
• Diestrus = pseudopregnancy
• “Covert” pseudopregnancy – no external signs; Hi P4 and
uterine growth
• “Overt” pseudopregnancy – Hi P4 and uterine growth
plus external signs including mammary gland
development and maternal behavior

“Postestrus”

Mean duration=14-21 d
From McDonald

Estrous Cycle
• Queen – several unique features
– Reflex ovulator
– Estrous cycle made up of two phases
• Estrus and proestrus; recently, “postestrus” has emerged
as the interval between estrus & proestrus
• No mating, cycles of estrus and proestrus continue thru
the breeding season

– Sterile mating – metestrus and diestrus occur
• Diestrus = pseudopregnancy; Hi P4 and uterine growth;
some mammary gland development may occur but not to
level of dog; usually no behavior change

Menstrual Cycle
• Characteristics
– Onset determined by menses
– Follicular and luteal phases are of equal
duration; each about 14 days
– Ovulation occurs mid-cycle
– No defined phase in the cycle where only at
that time will the female be sexually
receptive to the male – no estrus
– Significant E2 production during the luteal
phase; presence of thecal islets in CL that
produce E2

Menstrual Cycle

E2
P4

Menstrual Cycle
• Why menses in primates but not in other
species?
– Anatomical differences in the endometrium
between menstrual and estrous cycling sp!!!
– Menstrual sp endometrium may be regarded as
more “sensitive” to effects of E2 and P4
– Significant endometrial growth and vascularization
occurs in the luteal phase due to E2 and P4
secretion in primates
– Spiral arteries (morphology = coiled spring)
penetrate the endometrium

Menstrual Cycle
• Primate endometrium

Endometrium

Myometrium

Menstrual Cycle
• Endometrial functional layer = stratum functionale
– Highly responsive to E2 and P4
– Undergoes considerable growth and differentiation,
especially the spiral arteries which grow at an accelerated
rate
– Completely lost during menses

• Endometrial basal layer = stratum basale
– Adjacent to the myometrium
– Less responsive to E2 and P4
– Straight arteries supply blood to this area
– Retained during menses
– Serves to regenerate the stratum functionale

Menstrual Cycle
• Why menses in primates but not in other species?
– No embryonic signal, CL regresses
– P4 and E2 decrease causing shrinkage and collapse of the
stratum functionale about the spiral arteries, compressing
the spiral arteries,  blood flow to the stratum functionale
and inducing ischemia and necrosis
– Onset of ischemia and necrosis causes release of vasoactive
substances (PGF2a)  intense spiral artery vasoconstriction
 shunts blood to the capillary plexus, venous lakes and
veins  rupture of these vessels  hemorrhaging
– Hemorrhaging persists due to the presence of tissue heparin
in the endometrium and blood and endometrial tissue are
voided for 4-5 days
– PGF2a stimulates myometrial contractions which aid in
expulsion of the necrotic functionale layer

Menstrual



Menstrual Cycle
• Menses
• No similar event in estrous cycling species
– Proestrous bleeding in the dog – High E2
increases capillary permeability, RBC leak into
endometrial lumen and are voided thru the
vagina
– Pseudomenstruation in the cow – Declining
E2 during metestrus (Hi during proestrus and
estrus) causes capillary fragility, RBC leak out
and are also voided thru the vagina
– No loss of endometrial tissue in either
species

Ovarian Cycles
• Induced or reflex ovulators
– Require copulation for ovulation
• including rabbits, cats, camelids, mink, ferrets, bears, skunks,
